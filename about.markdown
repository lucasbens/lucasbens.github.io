I am Lucas, a Data Scientist at Meta _(by Qualitest)_ in Tel-Aviv, where I have been conducting data analytics, engineering, and machine learning projects since January 2021.

My background is in Mathematics and Information Systems. I did my master's at Sorbonne. 

I come from France, I gained valuable experiences there by working for two years as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst.

**Why I decided to move to Israel?**
I worked for a summer in the dynamic world of a startup in Tel Aviv. This experience inspired me to be part of the vibrant tech nation of Israel and thrive in its inspiring environment.
