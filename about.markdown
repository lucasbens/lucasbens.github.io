👋 I am Lucas, a <font color="#CC7722"><strong>Data Scientist</strong></font>
 at Meta _(by Qualitest)_ in  <font color="#CC7722">Tel-Aviv</font>, where I have been conducting data analytics, engineering, and machine learning projects since January 2021.

My background is in Mathematics and Information Systems. I did my master's at Sorbonne. 

I come from France 🇫🇷, I gained valuable experiences there by working for two years as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst.

**🤔 Why I decided to move to Israel 🇮🇱?** <br>
I worked for a summer in the dynamic world of a startup in Tel Aviv. This experience inspired me to be part of the vibrant tech nation of Israel and thrive in its inspiring environment.
